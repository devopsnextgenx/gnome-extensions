We first create a dictionary to store the count of each character\n2. We iterate through the string to count occurrences of each character\n3. We then iterate through the string again to find the last character that has a count > 1\n4. Finally, we return a tuple with the character and its count, or None if no repeating character is found\n\nWould you like me to provide additional test cases or modify the function in any way?"
